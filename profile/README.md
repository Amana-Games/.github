# Amana Games: Crafting Worlds with Open Hearts and Tools

Welcome to the heart of **Amana Games**. We are an independent, small-scale studio located in a quiet, small town in the interior of **São Paulo, Brazil**. Here, far from the noise of large tech hubs, we blend the precision of professional engineering with the soul of artisanal craftsmanship. 

We believe that games are the ultimate convergence of art and logic. We approach development not as a factory, but as a digital workshop—small by choice, but ambitious by vision.

## 🌿 Our Philosophy: Small Team, Grand Polish

At Amana, our size is our strength. We don't strive to be the biggest; we strive to be the most meticulous.

*   **Ambitious Polish**: Being "small" doesn't mean "simple." We have a stubborn obsession with product polish. From the fluidity of our SDK to the atmosphere of our games, we aim for a level of technical excellence and artistic "feel" that challenges the status quo of indie development.
*   **Mental Health First**: We reject the "crunch" culture. We believe that a creative mind thrives in a healthy, balanced environment. Our workflow respects the human behind the keyboard, ensuring that every project is a labor of love, not exhaustion.
*   **Open Minded & Open Source**: We are children of the open-source revolution. Our technology—from our custom SDK to our tool forks—is built on pillars of transparency and collaboration.
*   **Artisanal Professionalism**: Working 100% remote from our homes, we maintain a level of rigor that matches global industry standards. Every line of code is handled with the care of an artisan and the discipline of a senior engineer.

## 🛠️ The Amana Stack: Our Digital Forge

We have carefully selected a stack that empowers creativity and guarantees ownership of our work.

*   **[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)**: Our engine of choice. We leverage its flexibility and open nature to build experiences that are uniquely ours.
*   **[Blender](https://www.blender.org/)**: For 3D modeling, sculpting, and animation. Our pipeline is deeply integrated with the Blender LTS ecosystem.
*   **[BLOCK]**: Our custom low-poly and entity design tool (powered by the Blockbench core). It’s the perfect bridge between restricted art and modern performance.
*   **[TRENCH]**: Our custom level design environment (powered by the TrenchBroom core). We appreciate the classic, tactile feel of CSG and bring it into the modern era.
*   **The Live-Sync Bridge**: Both **TRENCH** and **BLOCK** communicate directly with Godot in real-time via **UDP**, allowing for unmatched iteration speeds.
*   **Amana SDK Hub**: Our custom-built central command. A tool made by developers, for developers, upkeeping our complex workflows.

**Ainimonia** is the culmination of our technical journey and our artistic expression. As a small studio, every piece of support matters. We are preparing for a **Crowdfunding Campaign** to bring this world to life, and we invite you to be part of an indie movement that values quality over quantity and people over pixels.
